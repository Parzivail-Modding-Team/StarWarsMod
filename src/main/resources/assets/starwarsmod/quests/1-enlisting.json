                "Look, I'm here to join the Rebel Alliance and restore the galaxy to its former peaceful state, if you don't want me just say so and you’ll never have to see me again.": "Oh come on, I'm just playin with ya, kid. We have to test the resolve of our new recruits to see if they are really Rebel material. You seem like you'll fit the bill perfectly. First things first though, we need to get you onto the range for some target practice, and that means you'll need a blaster. Head back to the Quartermaster and pick up an A-280 Blaster Rifle. Then meet me back here and we'll head to the range to see if you really have what it takes to blast some Imperial scum."
