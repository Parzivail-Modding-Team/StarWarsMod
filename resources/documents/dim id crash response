You have another mod also trying to use the dimension id 2. Go into your minecraft folder, then go to the config folder. Open our config (starwarsmod) and you'll see all of our dimension id's. You can change the numbers yourself in that file, and make sure you save. Basically just change the number for whichever dimension is using the id number 2. Just increase the number to something that isn't being used. Try 18 for starters? It just depends on what else you have installed. Play around with that then you'll be able to play.
