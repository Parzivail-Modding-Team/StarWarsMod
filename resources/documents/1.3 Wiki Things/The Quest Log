#The Quest Log#

****

*The Quest Log must remain in your inventory at all times in order to keep track of your Quest progress.*

****

The Quest Log is a place to keep track of your progress across the various Quest Trees.  It can be crafted on Earth, and must be crafted before you can travel to any other [[ Planets ]].  It is where a large amount of your in-game data is stored and your data will be lost to you if you lose it.  That means that you will have to restart all Questlines, lose your rank and progress in factions, and re-obtain any and all Hyperdrives.  **In short, DO NOT lose your Quest Log.**
