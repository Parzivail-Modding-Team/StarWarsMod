**Planet Information**

1. **Earth:** The birthplace of the Human Race and the original center of all galactic trade. Not much is known about this planet, and its place in Galactic history is still disputed.

1. **Tatooine:** A sparsely inhabited desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet is oppressed by a scorching sun, resulting in a lack of necessary surface water.

1. **Yavin 4:** One of three habitable moons orbiting the gas giant Yavin. It is mainly covered in jungle and rainforest, and despite being remote and unheard of, it plays an important role in galactic events. **Serves as the main headquarters of the Rebel Alliance.**

1. **Endor:** Also known as the Forest Moon of Endor and the Sanctuary Moon) is a small forested moon orbiting the gas giant planet of Endor and is the farthest moon away from it. **Home to the Headquarters of the Galactic Empire.**

1. **Hoth:** The sixth planet of the remote Hoth system. A desolate world covered with ice and snow, located in the Anoat sector, a rarely-traveled portion of the Outer Rim Territories. **Home to a large Rebel base.**

1. **Ilum:** An arctic planet located in the Unknown Regions. It was used by the Jedi Order for the Gathering, a rite of passage in which Jedi younglings must find and harvest kyber crystals for their lightsabers.

1. **Dagobah:** A planet in the Dagobah system, and one of the purest places in the galaxy within the Force. A remote world of swamps and forests, it serves as a refuge for Jedi Grand Master Yoda during his exile since the destruction of the Jedi Order.

1. **Kashyyyk:** A temperate jungle planet orbiting around a single star located in the Mytaranor sector of the Mid Rim, and has a complement of three moons. It was a member of the Galactic Republic and after the Clone Wars endured enslavement under the Galactic Empire.

1. **Wild Space:** An unknown region of space littered with asteroids and without affiliation.  Pilots of the different factions often come here to train and familiarize themselves with deep space flight.
